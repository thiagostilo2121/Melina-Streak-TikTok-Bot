WELCOME! GREETINGS FROM THE CREATOR AND DEVELOPER OF "MELINA STREAK TIKTOK BOT"
@thiagostilo2121 - GitHub
@stilo.tvl - Instagram

First of all, I want to inform you that this program is in its ALPHA version, which means it is subject to constant changes and possible bugs that will be fixed over time. I also apologize for the lengthy and tedious manual installation and configuration process (outlined below). This is due to:  
1. Ensuring user security so you don't feel your TikTok account is compromised.  
2. The program CANNOT log in to TikTok accounts because of the platform's verification process.  

Despite this, I will strive to improve the installation and configuration process in the future.

1 - INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION PROCESS
-------------------------------------------

1. Download the program from the GitHub repository and open the `install.py` file.

2. Open the `Config.lnk` (or just `Config`) file and select the first option.

3. Enter the EXACT* name (including uppercase, lowercase, and other characters) you want to assign to the Google Chrome profile to be used.

4. Enter the EXACT* name of the Windows user that hosts the Google Chrome profile.

5. Reopen the `Config` file.

6. Select the second option and specify the time in 24-hour format (xx:xx) for the automatic message to be sent.

7. (STEP 6, THEN SELECT 3RD OPTION) Enter the name you want to give the file used to identify a target user, followed by the EXACT* name of the target user on TikTok so the program can recognize them.

8. (STEP 6, THEN SELECT 4TH OPTION) Enter the message you want to send to the target user.

9. Open the `Start` file and log in to TikTok at least once (you won't need to do this again after the first login).

10. CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION PROCESS FOR "MELINA STREAK TIKTOK BOT." Below, you'll find solutions to common issues you may encounter.

* Include uppercase, lowercase, and any other special characters in the profile name.

2 - POSSIBLE ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS
---------------------------------

1. "The conversation with the specified user was not found."  
   This might happen if you've entered the target user's name incorrectly or if the user is not in your primary message inbox. To resolve this, send a message to the target user and try again.

Thank you for using my program. I promise to improve it in the future!
